# Ambarisha

Ambarisha is a Unicode font that supports the Kannada and Latin scripts. 
It is named after the famous Kannada actor and politician Ambarisha.

Ambarisha is a clean condensed sans typeface with an organic feel. It began with the Latin design by Kelvin Maa, which was inspired by his own painted signage designs, and then Appaji Ambarisha Darbha extended the design to support Kannada. It offers a distinctive character that is maintained across a wide range of sizes. It was made to function well in a display role at large sizes, while the open contours and robust design make it legible at text sizes. The simple clear shapes also make it perfect for web and screen reading. The type's personality is intended to be both vigorous and firm, warm and approachable. The same personality and consideration has been instilled into all of the glyphs found in the design, making it a truly multi-purpose design.
